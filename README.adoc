= geneclipsetoc-maven-plugin

Maven plugin to generate an eclipse help `toc.xml` file from existing html files.

== Description

This is a maven plugin that takes as input an ordered list of HTML pages and that generate a table of content file (`toc.xml` file) for these pages.
With this xml file, it is possible to publish the HTML pages as guide in an link:{eclipse_help_center}[Eclipse Help Center].

The approach was originally described here: link:{blog}[Generating Eclipse Help from existing HTML Documentation]

It is based on the link:{wikitext}[mylyn-wikitext] project and very similar to the `wikitext-to-eclipse-help` task provided by the project.
The only difference here is that there is no markup to HTML conversion during the process.

If you think that `geneclipsetoc` should be contributed to the mylyn-wikitext project, please give your opinion on link:{bug478466}[Bug 478466].

== Usage

Check out the link:examples/[examples].
